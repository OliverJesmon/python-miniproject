Simple chat\forum application using Python
An anonymous chat room.
Built a Python chatroom app supporting up to 10 concurrent users. 
The admin shares a unique server address for others to join. 
Leveraged Tkinter for GUI, sockets for networking, and multithreading for
efficient server-side operations. 
This project served as a miniproject for an application development course.

Libraries used:
1)PyQT5 - for user interface
2)Socket - for network programming
